BikeFitBeta is a small project designed around getting people out and moving.

I work in a bike shop, and this project was started because we have a need in my town for a program of this nature.  Many people here see bicyclists out on high-end road bikes, and don't make any sort of emotional connection to bikes a form of transportation or exercise.  The point of this is to get people out and moving by making the exercise portion of it as social and rewarding as possible.

As it stands now, this is a relatively simple app -- user profiles, ride records, weight records, and achievements.  Other features will be added eventually (such as organization support, email marketing, etc).
